Intro to Reading Ruby Error Messages
Overview
In this lab, you'll be reading error messages from tests. This lab is designed so that both running the files and running the test suite via the learn command will show the error messages for you to decode. Moving forward though, you'll be reading error messages mainly through running the test suite.

Get started by opening this lab by pressing the Open button on the toolbar so you can follow along with the video and solve this lab.

Objectives

Identify four error types- name errors, syntax errors, type errors, and division errors- and fix them
Describe a test suite, where it's found in a lab, and its purpose
Use the learn command in terminal to run the tests for a lab.
